# SimpleToDo

SimpleToDo is (as the name suggests) a very simple todo application build using Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, [Material Design Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/). The user data is stored and persisted in the browsers local storage, which is why the entire application is able to function without any backend or database. After creating the application PWA support was added using Google's ["Workbox CLI"](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox).
